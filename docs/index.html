    <h2 style="margin-top:70px;">Who am I:</h2>
    <p>I'm a husband, father, and forever student. I just finished my Bachelor of Science in I.T. with a concentration in JAVA and Python programming. 
    I've exposed myself to many facets of the IT industry. From responsive web design and pygames, to offensive security and penetration testing. 
    Everything I have had a chance to learn has been an absolutely joy. This June I will be transitioning out of the military and am actively looking 
    for a remote career. In the mean time I am continuing my personal education. I will be taking a prepatory course for the CompTIA Security+ starting 
    April 16th, I will also be starting my Master of Science in Cybersecurity this May. I believe that the better I become at development, the better 
    I will be long term with security.</p>

    <h2>Fun Projects:</h2>
    <p>The first thing I started working on when learning to code was a text based dungeon game. I found this to be a great way to work 
    on loops, and it also allowed me to slowly create more complex games. I later followed a tutorial to create a Space Invader game commonly known as 
    SHMUP (shoot'em up). This helped to solidify OOP concepts and gave me a better understanding of how to properly use objects. Moving forward, 
    I also followed a course on edX to learn about some machine learning (ML) concepts. I then utilized these to create a program that went through a 
    text file maze to find the shortest/fastest path from start to finish. After completing these, I ventured to TryHackMe.com and begain completing their 
    'rooms'. Through these rooms I learning about Linux CLI, Hashing, NMAP, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Open Source Intelligence, etc.</p>
