  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Job:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
        I am currently a <a href="https://youtu.be/FXvF_cBoHGE" style="color:blue">Yeoman (YN)</a> with the United States Coast Guard. This position has afforded me the opportunity to work with service members from new recruits up to the Commandant himself. Not only that, it has also allowed me to spend more time at home vice my previous position. This has been a catalyst for me to learn how to be a software developer and work remotely from here on out.
      </p><hr>
    <h2>Education:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
          I have recently completed my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Programming with American Military University (AMU). All major 
        and concentration courses were passed with A's and I achieved an overall GPA of 3.93 on a 4.0 scale. I am currently enrolled in AMU's Master of Science in Cybersecurity program. This program will begin in June 2021.
      </p><hr>
    <h2>Hobies:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
          In my free time I love to cycle. Cycling helps me to stay in shape, improves my energy and concentration, and helps me to clear my mind. A favorite 'game' of mine while riding is what I call Cat & Mouse. When I see a cyclist ahead of me, I get an uncontrollable urge to push harder till I catch and surpass them. This is what helps me to constantly push through plateaus and reach new goals.
      </p><hr>
    <h2>Future:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
          I hope to use the next few years to further develop my own skills and become competant/proficient at coding. Not just the coding but also the methodologies and how teams efficiently work together. Once I have experience in most of that, I wish to turn around and be a mentor to others breaking into the field. There are plenty of resources out there for people to learn, yet sometimes what people really need is a champion to help guide and encourage them. I wish to be that champion and to push others to become greater than myself.
