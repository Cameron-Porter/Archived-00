  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Work:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
        I am currently a Yeoman (YN) with the United States Coast Guard. Here is a glimpse into what I have done and continue to do till my 
        contract comes to an end:
        
            - PROBLEM SOLVING, ANALYSIS, FACT-FINDING: Developed creative solutions for improving organizational efficiency and policy. 
        Compiled personnel evaluations data, and prepared reports by transcribing data for conference presentation by senior officers. 
        Merged Microsoft Word and Excel to create graphics that showed quantitative analysis. Made arrangements for conferences and meetings.
            - LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT: Administrative Office Technician supervised 2 subordinates and trained 2 supervisors while providing 
        administrative support for over 350 military personnel. Established priorities, created travel itineraries, hotel reservations, and 
        prepared travel vouchers for active duty members stationed at outlying units. Read and analyzed incoming correspondence, and reports 
        to determine their significance and prioritize their distribution. Monitored performance and tracked progress by establishing monthly 
        spreadsheets to ensure accuracy and consistency with established procedures.
            - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT: Audited the personnel/pay records of up to 350 active duty and reserve members located across 5 states to 
        ensure accuracy and consistency with established procedures. Corrected severe pay discrepancies for members, and provided financial 
        counseling to members resulting in over $2 million worth of entitlements being awarded.
        
        Prior to becoming a YN, I conducted Law Enforcement and Search & Rescue on the Great Lakes. My position afforded me the opportunity 
        to do the below:
        
            - Conducted safety boardingâ€™s to ensure boaters were in compliance with federal laws and regulations. Also, conducted search and 
        rescue missions in the Straits of Mackinac. This area includes the Les Cheneaux Islands, Round Island Passage, Cheboygan, and West to Hog Island.
            - Conducted training for members in a variety of areas to include: emergency procedures, close quarter combat, seamanship, navigation, and 
        vessel maintenance.
            - Performed maintenance on both our small boats and the station to keep them operationally ready.

    <h2>Education:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
          Currently enrolled in American Military University's (AMU) Master of Science in Cybersecurity program. This program will begin in May 2021.
        
          I have recently completed my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Programming with AMU. All major 
        and concentration courses were passed with A's and I achieved an overall GPA of 3.93 on a 4.0 scale.
      </p><hr>
    <h2>Average Pay:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
          Pay for this career is largely based on experience and location. For
        instance, if you are going for an entry level position then you could
        expect to make about $70k in the midwest compared to $105k in Silicon
        Valley. The more experience you have, the greater your pay will be as
        well as additional benefits. These could include company paid helthcare,
        continued education, or even profit sharing. As an example, you may make
        a base of $105k with Google in CA, but you could additionally get $50k
        worth of stocks each year. This would bring your total annual income to
        $155k.
      </p><hr>
    <h2>Work Environment:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
          Most software engineers work in an office setting with an open floor
          plan. Open floor plans at most companies allow for greater
          communication and collaboration. If you choose to contract and work
          for yourself, then your work environment can be anything you wish it
          to be. You are only limited by your imagination.
