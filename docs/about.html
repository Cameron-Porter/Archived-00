  <h1>Expectations</h1>
    <h2>Job Outlook:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
            Software Engineering is a rapidly growing career field. The average
          growth rate for this specialty is about 20% from 2018 --> 2028. So the
          likelyhood of you being left without job is extremely rare for the
          foreseeable future (2019).
      </p><hr>
    <h2>Education Requirements:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
          Most software engineering positions require a bachelors degree in
        computer science or a related field at minimum. However you can also
        have relavant experience for about the same amount of time it takes for
        the required degree, and could still land a job. It truly boils down to
        your proven skill set and how well you can market yourself to your
        perspective employer. For information on a relavant certification to help you on your
        journey,

      </p><hr>
    <h2>Average Pay:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
          Pay for this career is largely based on experience and location. For
        instance, if you are going for an entry level position then you could
        expect to make about $70k in the midwest compared to $105k in Silicon
        Valley. The more experience you have, the greater your pay will be as
        well as additional benefits. These could include company paid helthcare,
        continued education, or even profit sharing. As an example, you may make
        a base of $105k with Google in CA, but you could additionally get $50k
        worth of stocks each year. This would bring your total annual income to
        $155k.
      </p><hr>
    <h2>Work Environment:</h2>
      <p style="text-indent:15px">
          Most software engineers work in an office setting with an open floor
          plan. Open floor plans at most companies allow for greater
          communication and collaboration. If you choose to contract and work
          for yourself, then your work environment can be anything you wish it
          to be. You are only limited by your imagination.
