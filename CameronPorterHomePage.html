    <p>This growing field encompasses multiple computer science processes "dedicated to creating, designing, deploying, and supporting software" (What is software development?, n.d.).
      There are two basic types of software that include system and application software.
      System software controls the internal computer operations and utilities; while, application software is a stand-alone program that solves a specific need.
      Software engineers are tasked with creating software within a set of requirements which is also maintainable, dependable, scalable, and efficient.</p>

    <h2>Why you should get into the field</h2>
    <p>Technology is continuing to grow and there is no plateau in sight.
      This career field has a very high demand.
      It has the possibility of remote work, so you don't have to worry about incredibly strict schedules or getting dressed each day.
      It is a career where you are in a constant state of learning.
      There will never be a day that you will not learn something new or how to be more efficient.
      Software engineering is a social career.
      You must interact with a myriad of people in order to continue down the software development life cycle (SDLC).
      There is also the opportunity to take your knowledge and experience and go "indie".
      Meaning you can work for youself and contract your services or create software to sell.
      Lastly, anyone can do it, but many won't.
      There are thousands of online resources that can help you achieve your goal.
      If you have the experience, you do not need a degree.
      That may help some people who struggle in school, yet excel at practical applications.
      Give it a shot and you won't regret it! (Copes, 2018)</p>
